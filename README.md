    "We at Virid Inc. know the struggle of having a messy Backpack that's filled with rations. 
    You never know when you might end up in an area without any food mysteriously lying around! 
    Well...if you ran into this very relatable problem, let us introduce: Lunchboxes!
    Lunchboxes are a handy piece of equipment if you happen to hoard a lot of food and you don't want to clutter your Backpack!
    Keep your Backpack clean and save the space for more important stuff, like a few extra Light Amp Goggles!"
    

## Mealkits:
    -Can be picked up and opened like Medikits
    -One Mealkit contains 2 meals and 1 drink
    -Contents might be spoiled or open
    -weighs 30 blocks
    -Loadout code: MKT
    -Class:  VirMealkit

    "If you don't like carrying rations everywhere you go and end up starving because of it, we got you covered!
    Mealkits are disposable lunchboxes that always contain 2 meals and a drink. Just pick them up and open them when the hunger strikes!
    Though our partner, the UAC, has to figure out a better way to transport these things.
    Some Mealkits get roughed up during transport and may contain damaged rations that are open and sometimes spoiled, YUK!!"
